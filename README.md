# Wordle

To play, simply follow these instructions:
1. Install an edition of Python on your computer.
2. Download the code and extract it into a folder.
    2b. I recommend using C:\Users\$username\Downloads\Wordle or something similar.
3. Locate the path you extracted the files and paste it into the following command:
    <code>cd $path</code>
4. Then, run the following code:
    <code>python main.py</code>

Have fun playing, and don't forget to check your high scores!
